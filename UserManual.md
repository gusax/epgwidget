Note that the english page might lag behind the swedish equivalent in updates, therefore it is not featured on the front page.

## Front side ##
On the front side, you can:

  * **Reorder channels** : To move a channel to a different position, drag the channel logo.

  * **Show program description** : Click the program title to open the program description window. Click the same title again to hide it. Click on another program to show its information instead. To scroll the program information, use the trackpad or mouse wheel.

  * **Scroll program description** : To scroll the program description, in case it doesn't fit the window, use the scrollwheel of the mouse or the trackpad on your laptop. There is no scrollbar at present, sorry :-(

  * **Enlarge the widget** : To enlarge the widget, providing that it doesn't grow taller than the height of the screen, press the large letter A in the bottom left corner. To shrink the widget, press the small letter A. To return to the original size, press the middle letter A.

## Back side ##
On the back side, you can:

  * **Add a channel to a channel list** : To add a channel to the currently active channel list, click the channel name or check the checkbox next to the name. The channel will then be added at the bottom of the channel list.

  * **Remove a channel from a channel list** : To remove a channel from the currently active channel list, click the channel name or uncheck the checkbox next to the name.
